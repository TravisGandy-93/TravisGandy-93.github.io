   I'm here because I cant see myself doing the basic entry level or physically demanding job anymore. I have done the food service job, I've done the retail job,  and I currently do security. I had been looking for a new direction for the past year or so but nothing seemed doable in the midst of keeping bills paid. So one day when my software engineering older brother comes over to visit, my niece and sister-in-law start telling me about Flat-iron and how they were learning to do what he does. Im immediately interested because I tend be interested in and good at the same things as my older brother, I'll never admit that in front of him though. As their explaining it to me, I start realizing I may have seen or heard a bit of the info before throughout my schooling so it seemed to be a no brainer by the time they explained how the scheduling of classes and finances worked.

   Aside from the genuine spark of interest I have now, I'm the type of person who looks beyond the initial results of a decision. So to me being a software engineer, in a world where tech and software are becoming more and more essential to the every day human being, seems like the smartest and safest move. Especially after witnessing how this pandemic has affected normal people's jobs, my brother was already working from home every day and really nothing has changed for him financially during this crisis. Seeing that was the extra kick in the back I needed to know that Im committed. so no matter how hard this stuff turns out to be im going to knock it out. My motto going forward is "Live a few years like most WON'T, to spend the rest like most CAN'T".
