If you're reading this, odds are we are both wizards in training right now. I say this because after building my first cli program, which was about 80% struggle for me, I got a taste of the magic we all strive for. Getting your code to work and seeing the results, no matter how small the adjustment you were goin for, is an amazing feeling. For example, getting my Api to work was probably the biggest moment for me in building my Cli. Trying over and over with different ways of arranging how and where I would input the variables, realizing the base URL needed my inputs to be encoded differently, to finding that there was a gem for that all lead to the moment of truth when you realize "am I freaking wizard? Yeah I'm definitely a wizard". That's a feeling that i thoroughly enjoyed after days and hours of staring at my screen waiting for the ideas to flow in.

The moments like that at my current level are few and far between but they seem pretty worth it and the distance between them is continuously shrinking as i gain more understanding.
